I created this space to weave those diferent pieces of my interets together.\nThe name subtly refers to the ML concept of a Convolutional Neural Network, a deep learning algorithm used mostly in image recognition.\nThe point is to find a connection between those seemingly different worlds, pull those threads together, and even if something still remains hidden - we can make our meaning out of it.\nAnd if this sounds a bit enigmatic\u0026hellip; call me Convoluted_M 🥁 .\n","permalink":"https://convolutedmeanings.com/meta/why-convoluted-meanings/","summary":"So what’s the story behind the name?\nIt was a dark autumnal evening and they were coming back home.

Thank you for coming. Would you like a cup of tea?\nMy interests span: NLP, AI assistants, translation, information architecture, conversation design, and more. These all sound like very lofty and aloof subjects but I promise you there is a job in there. I might weave into those topics some reflections on inclusion because of my personal journey.\n \nP.S. If you are wondering how to pronounce my first name (let’s start with the easier one), please click on the icon below:\n Your browser does not support the audio element.   And if you’d like to geek out a bit more, here are two pronunciations of my name:\nPolish using the Slavic phonetic alphabet (AS)\n /mar‘tyna/\n \u0026hellip;and the anglicised version using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\n /ma:(r)‘ti:nə/\n More on phonetic alphabets for Polish transcription by Grzegorz Jagodziński.\nConvoluted Meanings If you\u0026rsquo;d like to know about the idea behind the name of the blog, why don\u0026rsquo;t you hop over to the post on it.\nLife I’m passionate about the philosophy and science of the mind. I basically love cool pictures of the brain with words like ‘Broca’s area’ written on them. Oh and mandalas. My limbic system really gets excited when I get hold of a book that marries Western scientific thought with the ancient wisdom of the East. I’m a beginner on the yoga mat. I passionately read about neuropeptides that are the link between the body and the mind, and that knock the Cartesian dualism off the contemplative shelf.\nSpeaking my voice Since I can remember I have scribbled verses, first to make them rhyme, then to not rhyme them (!!) and finally letting them flow in whatever shapes they come about, picturing the images in my head. I love poetry and I can\u0026rsquo;t paint. And I am an amateur. I love reading poetry to the window and to the surprise of two Italian Greyhounds. And to the camera.\nPS I recently started experimenting with singing, I feel I’m onto something\u0026hellip;\nWalking my path I feel at home in the hills and mountains and I’ve been compared to a goat (which I believe is a compliment). I also strongly believe in walking our path in life, staying true to ourselves, and learning to be compassionate.\nThank you for popping in. 🫖\n","permalink":"https://convolutedmeanings.com/about/","summary":"Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Martyna and I’m a language nerd.\nI discovered that reading poetry isn’t as cool as it used to be a few centuries ago so I switched to Machine Learning (ML).\nOn a more serious note, I’m a linguist who journeyed into the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) and managed to dig so many rabbit holes in the process that I wanted to share some of those explorations with you.","title":"Hey, it's me!"}]
