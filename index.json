And that what makes life fun to live.\nGiven those philosophical ramblings and a diverse number of my interests (as well as some brainstorming with my Best Ginger Ever aka Myles), I decided to call my blog \u0026lsquo;Convoluted Meanings\u0026rsquo;. It leaves a wide enough space to contain the multitude of me and the expanding world of AI that we are all so curious about. The name also subtly refers to the ML concept of a Convolutional Neural Network ‚Üó, a deep learning algorithm used mostly in image recognition.\nThe point is, even if things seem tangled as my hair we can brush through them together and make our meaning out of them.\nAnd if this sounds a bit enigmatic\u0026hellip; call me Convoluted_M (ba dum tsh! ü•Å) .\n","permalink":"https://convolutedmeanings.com/meta/why-convoluted-meanings/","summary":"Life is not linear, ok?\nAs much as the logical part of our brains loves the clear edges of \u0026ldquo;black or white\u0026rdquo; and step-by-step thinking, wherever we look we see how processes are intricately entwined.

Thank you for coming. Would you like a cup of tea?\nMy interests span: NLP, AI assistants, translation, knowledge management, and more. These all sound like very lofty and aloof subjects but I promise you there is a job in there. I might weave into those topics some reflections on inclusion because of my personal journey ‚Üó.\nP.S. If you are wondering how to pronounce my first name (let‚Äôs start with the easier one), please click on the icon below:\nYour browser does not support the audio element. And if you‚Äôd like to geek out a bit more, here are two pronunciations of my name:\nPolish using the Slavic phonetic alphabet (AS)\n/mar‚Äòtyna/\n\u0026hellip;and the anglicised version using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\n/ma:(r)‚Äòti:n…ô/\nMore on phonetic alphabets for Polish transcription by Grzegorz Jagodzi≈Ñski ‚Üó.\nConvoluted Meanings If you\u0026rsquo;d like to know about the idea behind the name of the blog, why don\u0026rsquo;t you hop over to the post on it ‚Üó.\nLife I‚Äôm passionate about the philosophy and science of the mind. I basically love cool pictures of the brain with words like ‚ÄòBroca‚Äôs area‚Äô written on them. Oh and mandalas. My limbic system gets really excited when I get hold of a book that marries Western scientific thought with the ancient wisdom of the East ‚Üó. I‚Äôm a beginner on the yoga mat. I passionately read about neuropeptides that are the link between the body and the mind ‚Üó, and that knock the Cartesian dualism ‚Üó off the contemplative shelf.\nSpeaking my voice Since I can remember I have scribbled verses, first to make them rhyme, then to not rhyme them (!!) and finally letting them flow in whatever shapes they come about, picturing the images in my head. I love poetry and I can\u0026rsquo;t paint. And I am an amateur. I love reading poetry ‚Üó to the window and to the surprise of two Italian Greyhounds. And to the camera ‚Üó.\nPS I recently started experimenting with singing, I feel I‚Äôm onto something\u0026hellip;\nWalking my path I feel at home in the hills and mountains and I‚Äôve been compared to a goat (which I believe is a compliment). I also strongly believe in walking our path in life, staying true to ourselves, and learning to be compassionate.\nFinding balance My personal story coupled with my philosophical interests has put me on a path of exploring the nature of the mind (or shall I say the body-mind), purpose and meaning. Our western culture has only recently started creating space for finding more balance between the different parts of our \u0026ldquo;self\u0026rdquo; and different areas of life. I hope to share some of my reflections and learnings on this journey. The name of the blog says it all. We are such a beautiful mosaic of interests, experiences and revelations.\nThank you for popping in. ü´ñ\n","permalink":"https://convolutedmeanings.com/about/","summary":"Background Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Martyna and I‚Äôm a language nerd.\nI discovered that reading poetry isn‚Äôt as cool as it used to be a few centuries ago so I switched to Machine Learning (ML).\nOn a more serious note, I‚Äôm a linguist who journeyed into the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) and managed to dig so many rabbit holes in the process that I wanted to share some of those explorations with you.","title":"Hey, it's me!"},{"content":"If you\u0026rsquo;re wondering what I‚Äôm up to besides bragging about linguistics and AI while sipping on another cup of Sencha, here‚Äôs a few things that I‚Äôm doing now.\nA shoutout to Derek Sivers ‚Üó for the idea behind the \u0026ldquo;Now Page\u0026rdquo;.\nI‚Äôm currently based in the north of the Emerald Isle, in a place called Belfast.
