Hi, my name is Martyna and I’m a language nerd.

I discovered that reading poetry isn’t as cool as it used to be a few centuries ago so I switched to Machine Learning (ML).

On a more serious note, I’m a linguist who journeyed into the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) and managed to dig so many rabbit holes in the process that I wanted to share some of those explorations with you. Thank you for coming. _Would you like a cup of tea?_

My interests span: NLP, AI assistants, translation, information architecture, conversation design, and more. These all sound like very lofty and aloof subjects but I promise you there is a job in there. I might weave into those topics some reflections on inclusion because of [my personal journey](https://owntrail.com/trail/convoluted_m).

_P.S._ If you are wondering how to pronounce my first name (let’s start with the easier one), please click on the icon below:

And if you’d like to geek out a bit more, here are two pronunciations of my name:

Polish using the Slavic phonetic alphabet (AS)

> /mar‘tyna/

...and the anglicised version using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)

> /ma:(r)‘ti:nə/
