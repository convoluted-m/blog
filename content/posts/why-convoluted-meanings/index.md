Life is not linear, ok?

As much as the logical part of our brain loves the clear edges of "black or white" and "first A, then B", life doesn't work that way. Think the multifaceted nature of reality or transformers (basic stuff of life, right?).

I came to love this cosmic mess. This might be because of my ADHD-like nature or maybe because I'm just a cool gal. Or rather because there often isn't one simple answer to a question - everything is intricately entwined. And that's what makes life fascinating.

Given those philosophical ramblings and a diverse number of my interests (as well as some brainstorming with my Best Ginger Ever aka Myles), I decided to call my blog "Convoluted Meanings". This name leaves a wide enough space to contain the multitude of me and the expanding world of AI that we are all so curious about. The name also subtly refers to the ML concept of a [Convolutional Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network), a deep learning algorithm used mostly in image recognition.

The point is, even if things seem as tangled as my hair we can comb through those threads towards some smoother ending.

And if this sounds a bit enigmatic... call me **Convoluted_M** (ba dum tsh! ü•Å).
