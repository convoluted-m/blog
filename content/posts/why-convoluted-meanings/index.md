So what’s the story behind the name?

_It was a dark autumnal evening and they were coming back home. She was tired after work and they didn’t have pickled cucumbers at Tesco. 'The name for the new blog', she thought, 'it has to be something that will combine tech and the study of language, what will give it a slightly philosophical twist'. Suddenly..._ 🛑 🤐

I want to put tech and "humanities" together. This is what I've been up to for the last two years. Before that, I spent 5 years studying linguistics, translation and second language acquisition. And then I became fascinated with language technologies🎉! I created this space to weave those pieces of my interests together.

The name subtly refers to the ML concept of a [Convolutional Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network), a deep learning algorithm used mostly in image recognition.

The point is to find a connection between those seemingly different worlds, pull those threads together, and even if something still remains hidden - we can make our meaning out of it.

And if this sounds a bit enigmatic... call me Convoluted_M (ba dum tsh! 🥁) .
