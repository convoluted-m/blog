So what‚Äôs the story behind the name?

_It was a dark autumnal evening and they were coming back home. She was tired after work, hadn't done her workout and they didn‚Äôt have pickled cucumbers at Tesco... 'What will I call my new blog? It has to be something that will combine Machine Learning and the study of language, what would give it a slightly philosophical twist'. Suddenly..._ üõë ü§ê

I want to put tech and "humanities" together. This is what I've been up to for the last two years. Before, that I spent 5 years studying linguistics, translation, second language acquisition, etc. And then I became fascinated with language technologies! I created this space to weave those diferent pieces of my interets together.

The name subtly refers to the ML concept of a [Convolutional Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network), a deep learning algorithm used mostly in image recognition.

The point is to find a connection between those seemingly different worlds, pull those threads together, and even if something still remains hidden - we can make our meaning out of it.

And if this sounds a bit enigmatic... call me Convoluted_M ü•Å .
